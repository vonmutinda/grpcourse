## gRPC - MasterClass
- A code along repo for [Udemy's gRPC [Golang] Masterclass course](https://www.udemy.com/course/grpc-golang/)

## Description
- `gRPC` is a `RPC` framework developed by Google for building high performance APIs. It's uses [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) as the interface definition language. gRPC payloads are significantly smaller than a JSON equivalents hence faster low latency over the wire. A good alternative for REST API. 

## Concepts Explored
- [x] Unary Streaming 
- [ ] Server Streaming
- [ ] Client Streaming  
- [ ] Bi-directional Streaming 
- [ ] Error Hanlding
- [ ] Security
- [ ] CRUD with MongoDB 

### Local Set Up
+ Clone the app `git clone https://github.com/vonmutinda/pipeline.git`
+ Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on your machine. 

## Technologies Used 
A list of technologies used in this project:
- [Golang version `go1.14.6`](https://golang.org) 
- [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go) gRPC framework.

## Resources
